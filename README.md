# CC-MAR-DATA_SCIENCE


## Project description
This project consists of two tasks completed as part of a project work assignment for Code Clause. The first task is an image color detection application that allows users to select an image and identify the color of any portion of the image using OpenCV. The second task is a brain tumor detection model that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify brain MRI images as either benign or malignant tumors, achieving an accuracy of around 89%.

## Technologies Used
1.  OpenCV (cv2): an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.
2.  Pandas: a data manipulation library used for data analysis and manipulation.
3.  Tkinter: a Python GUI toolkit used for creating graphical user interfaces.
4.  TensorFlow: an open source machine learning framework developed by Google.
5.  Scikit-learn: a machine learning library for Python.
6.  NumPy: a library for working with arrays.
7.  Matplotlib: a plotting library for Python.
8.  Keras: an open source deep learning library written in Python.
9.  Imutils: a library for performing image processing tasks in OpenCV.
10. OS: a Python module that provides a way of interacting with the operating system.
11. ImageDataGenerator: a class in Keras that generates batches of augmented data from image files.
