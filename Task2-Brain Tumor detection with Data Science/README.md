## TASK-2 Brain Tumor Detection using CNN :
this is the project which allows the user to detect whether the brain tumor is present in the MRI scan or not. Firstly the MRI images with labels are taken from the kaggle. There are in total of 250 images which are then passed for data augmentation so that data can be increased. so, after data augmentation the total images are around 2000.

Now, the images are been cropped and stored and finally trained in the CNN model. this is the architecture of the mode:

and finally we are getting the accuracy to be around 89%
